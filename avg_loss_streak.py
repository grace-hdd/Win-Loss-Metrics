def avg_loss_streak(prices):

    Calculate the average loss streak length.
    
    This function finds all loss streaks and calculates their average length,
    providing insight into typical sustained bearish momentum patterns.
    
    Args:
        prices (list): List or array of price data in chronological order.
                      Must contain at least 2 data points.
    
    Returns:
        float: Average length of loss streaks.
               - 0.0: No loss streaks or insufficient data
               - 1.0+: Average number of consecutive red days per streak
    
    Example:
        >>> prices = [100, 98, 95, 105, 102, 99, 96, 110, 108]
        >>> avg_loss_streak(prices)
