    Calculate the average win streak length.
    
    This function finds all win streaks and calculates their average length,
    providing insight into typical sustained bullish momentum patterns.
    
    Args:
        prices (list): List or array of price data in chronological order.
                      Must contain at least 2 data points.
    
    Returns:
        float: Average length of win streaks.
               - 0.0: No win streaks or insufficient data
               - 1.0+: Average number of consecutive green days per streak
    
    Example:
        >>> prices = [100, 102, 105, 95, 98, 101, 104, 90, 92]
        >>> avg_win_streak(prices)
